Multi-Asset Portfolio Simulation & Optimization using Monte Carlo Methods

This project performs Monte Carlo simulations on historical asset prices to estimate risk/return characteristics and identify optimal portfolio allocations. It implements a complete workflow including preprocessing, simulation, performance estimation, optimization, and visualization.

Key Features:

-Data Analysis: Cleaning and scaling historical stock prices.

-Visualization: Interactive candlestick charts and correlation heatmaps using Plotly and Seaborn.

-Simulation: Running 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations to simulate portfolio performance.

-Optimization: identifying the optimal asset weights to maximize risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio). Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Cufflinks.
