**Python Options Pricing Engine**
I built this tool to explore the relationship between analytical and numerical pricing methods in quantitative finance. It prices European Options (Calls & Puts) using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) formula and validates those results using a Monte Carlo Simulation.

The Goal:
To prove that as simulation iterations increase, the stochastic price converges to the analytical "ground truth" price.
